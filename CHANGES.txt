1.2.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.2.0 (2017-04-17)
------------------

- Added ``MANIFEST.in``.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


1.1 (2009-02-26)
----------------

- Move the ``exclude`` directive into the original ``zope.configuration``
  package.

  So, this package is currently contains only a backward-compatibility
  import for ``exclude`` directive and is not useful anymore. However
  it's intended to contain miscellaneous extensions to the configuration
  framework and may contain more in future, so we are not marking is
  as deprecated for now.


1.0 (2007-09-29)
----------------

Initial release.
